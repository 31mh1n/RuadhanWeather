# Weather Pulling

First thing you need to run in the terminal is `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you will only need to interact with `main.py`

You will only need to set the following variables


## Variables
1. `PLACE` -- The location of where you are looking ex. Grange
2. `COUNTY` -- The county of the place ex. Sligo
3. `COUNTRY` -- The country of the place ex. Ireland
4. `START YEAR` -- The first year you want to pull data from (inclusive) ex. 2021
5. `END YEAR` -- The last year you want to pull data from (inclusive) ex. 2021

## File Storage
After you run the `main.py` a file will be created title `PLACE-COUNTY-COUNTRY_START YEAR-END YEAR` ex. `Grange-Sligo-Ireland_2021-2021`
